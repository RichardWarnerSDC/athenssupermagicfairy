As we have a non conventional quiz game, hopefully this document will be clear and concise enough to explain it! Super Magic Fairy Fun Quiz (SMFFQ) is a competitive quiz based on the modules in the MSc Computer Science course at Birmingham. Users compete against each other in a first come first serve quiz where the options are limited to only one per player. Each player in a game must race to take the correct answer as quick as possible!
How does the quiz work?
Just like a normal quiz- with a twist! Each question has four options- only one of which is correct. When a player selects an option, then they have claimed it and no other player can select this option.
Scoring System
Every game consists of 10 questions. After a question has been asked, the server will wait for any of the clients to respond.
Once the server receives its first response, the server will start a 5 second timer.
The 5 second timer indicates the time remaining for each of the other players to answer.
The points will be distributed as follows:
The player (if any) who answers it correctly-> PLUS 100(k/5) where k is the time remaining on the timer. This means that if they are the FIRST person to answer and they choose the correct answer, they obtain a full 100 points.
Any players who select incorrect answers-> MINUS 50.
Any players who do NOT answer-> 0 points.
An example is where players 1-4 all answer, say player 2 answers correctly, but with 3 seconds left on the timer. Then the players 1, 3 and 4 would have minus 50 points but player 2 obtains 60 points.
Another example is where players 1 and 2 answer, say player 1 answers correctly, but with 1 second left on the timer. Then the player 2 would have minus 50 points, player 1 obtains 20 points and players 3 and 4 get nothing.
At the end of a game, players will get the following bonus points, according to position:
1st = 200
2nd = 100
3rd = 50
4th = 25
The points that the players end with are added onto their total experience which then translates to their rank (see below).
If a player ends with negative points, then we only add the bonus points to their rank (i.e. they cannot derank).
If there are less than 4 players, we work from the top (e.g. out of 2 players, first will get 200 and second will get 100).
Ranking System
Each players rank is based on their total experience (or total score):
